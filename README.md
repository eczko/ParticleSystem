#p5js Text Particle System - Generated by ChatGPT
This project is generated by OpenAI's language model, ChatGPT. It uses the p5.js library to create a particle system out of a given text. The code is written in JavaScript and utilizes the p5.js library to create a unique and visually appealing animation.

#What the code does
The code takes a text input and converts it to a set of points using the textToPoints() function. These points are then used to create particles that are displayed on the canvas. The particles move away from the mouse when the mouse is close to the text and move back to their original position when the mouse is far away.
